### 📦 NAS Project – Go Server & Rust Client

This project is a simple, fast, and secure Network-Attached Storage (NAS) system built using:

* 🚀 **Go** for the backend server
* ⚙️ **Rust** for the client application

---

## 📁 Features

* File Upload & Download
* User Authentication (Optional)
* Secure API communication (TLS/HTTPS support)
* Multi-client support
* File listing and management
* Platform-agnostic client (Rust)
* Configurable storage paths

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

* Go (1.20+)
* Rust (Stable)
* Git

---

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nas-project.git
cd nas-project
```

---

### 🖥️ Server (Go)

#### Build & Run

```bash
cd server
go build -o nas-server
./nas-server
```

#### Environment Variables / Config

* `PORT` – default `8080`
* `STORAGE_PATH` – default `./data`
* `TLS_CERT` – path to TLS certificate (optional)
* `TLS_KEY` – path to TLS key (optional)

---

### 💻 Client (Rust)

#### Build & Run

```bash
cd client
cargo build --release
./target/release/nas-client --help
```

#### Sample Usage

```bash
nas-client upload /path/to/file.txt
nas-client download file.txt
nas-client list
```

> Ensure the server is running before using the client.

## 🔐 Security Notes

* Communication is secured using HTTPS if TLS is enabled.
* Recommend using a reverse proxy (like Caddy or Nginx) for production.
* Future features may include token-based auth or OAuth.

---

## 🧪 Testing

* Use `curl`, Postman, or the Rust client to test API endpoints.
* Add unit tests in both server and client directories.

---

## 📚 Roadmap

* [ ] Add WebSocket support for real-time sync
* [ ] Web dashboard (optional)
* [ ] Encrypted file storage
* [ ] Access logs and metrics
